# Super GEDEX - Data Extraction & RPA Tool ⚡

An RPA (Robotic Process Automation) tool built with Python and Selenium for bulk data extraction, project status tracking, and document downloading from the GEDEX corporate system (Cemig).

## 🎯 The Problem & Justification

The corporate GEDEX system lacks developer-friendly APIs, bulk export capabilities, and macro-level workflow visualization. To consolidate project data (workflow status, update dates, edit history, and disciplines), engineers and analysts were forced to manually navigate through the system, clicking through slow UI modals to copy data one by one. 

This human I/O bottleneck caused delays in SLA tracking and hindered a systemic view of engineering projects. **Super GEDEX** solves this by simulating structured human navigation, handling network load exceptions (explicit waits), and autonomously compiling scattered data into analytical Excel (`.xlsx`) reports.

## 🚀 Core Features (MVP)

* **Bulk Extraction:** Search multiple Substation codes or specific Document IDs simultaneously.
* **Advanced Filtering:** Segment extraction by engineering discipline (e.g., Primary Equipment, Secondary Equipment, Transformers).
* **Workflow Intelligence:** Deep parses the workflow history modal to identify approvals, rejections, and strictly counts the exact number of document revisions/edits.
* **Automated Downloads:** Option to automatically fetch and save physical file packages (ZIPs) tied to each record.
* **Modern GUI:** User-friendly native interface built with Tkinter featuring Dark/Light mode, real-time logging, dynamic progress bars, and ETA calculations.
* **Zero Friction:** Auto-generates structured Pandas dataframes and automatically opens the output directory upon completion.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Python 3.11.9**
* **Selenium WebDriver:** Web automation, JavaScript injection, and DOM parsing.
* **Tkinter / TTK:** Native graphical user interface construction.
* **Pandas:** Data structuring, cleaning, and Excel exportation.
* **Regex (`re`):** Strict string manipulation for discipline and ID identification.
* **PyInstaller:** Compilation into a standalone `.exe` executable.

## 💡 Business Value & Use Cases

The reports generated by this robot serve as the primary ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) layer for:
* **Power BI Dashboards:** Feeding dashboards to plot project health, average approval times, and bottlenecks by engineering discipline.
* **Vendor Management:** Utilizing the revision count data to measure the rework rate of third-party designers.
* **Automated Follow-ups:** Integrating the output spreadsheet with email scripts to automatically notify departments holding pending analysis.

## 🚧 Roadmap & Future Improvements (Technical Debt)

The current project was built as a monolithic MVP focused on rapid value delivery. Upcoming iterations will focus on architectural robustness and performance:

- [ ] **MVC Modularization:** Decouple the Selenium business logic (Back-end) from the Tkinter interface (Front-end) using callbacks and dependency injection.
- [ ] **API Reverse Engineering:** Transition from UI-based scraping (Selenium clicks) to direct HTTP requests (`requests`) targeting internal GEDEX endpoints, drastically reducing extraction time.
- [ ] **Headless CLI Mode:** Enable invisible execution via command line to run on servers or schedule tasks with minimal RAM consumption.
- [ ] **Session Persistence:** Cache authentication cookies to bypass repeated CAPTCHA inputs during short-interval sessions.
